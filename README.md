# Project Title
Kmeans Clustering Of Students & Kmeans in 3D
# Problem Statement
Implemention of Kmeans using python sklearn library. We will use Kmeans to cluster students dataset, and try to use the 3D concept on Kmeans Clustering.
# Dataset Used
STUDENT_CGPA

# What are the required python packages?
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
# Machine Learning Algorithm Used:-
- Kmeans Algorithm
# Observation: 
In this program we observe that kmeans clustering help us to make the clear visible on chart , how to focus on student and how to categories them upon tere CGPA and IQ Level this help to focus on the weak student. likethis, only we can do clustering on images,patients,clients etc. in 3D concept we see how we can uses 3D chart to explain things more better than 2D.
# Conclusion:
Here are some output of the data .first chart show the p[resentation of students acccording to there groups and in 3D image we can categories them accordinng to there groups in 3D chart.
